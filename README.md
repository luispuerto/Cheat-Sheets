# RStudio Cheat Sheets 

This is a collection of R, Git and other interesting things cheat sheets that I've downloaded mainly from the [RStudio site][] although some of them are form other sources. 

I keep this mainly a repository for me, but perhaps it's useful for someone so I'll keep it open. 

Last time [RStudio site][] was checked for new sheet was: Tue, 21 Feb 2021 at 13:30 CET

Checked means that I have it printed. You can check what I have pending [2Print](2Print.md). 

I've also created a PDF with all the cheatsheets I print [All R cheatsheets.pdf](All R cheatsheets.pdf). It's ignored by git for now.

The tidy evaluation framework is implemented by the [rlang](https://rlang.r-lib.org/) package and used by functions throughout the tidyverse.
